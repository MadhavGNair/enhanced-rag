EIS00049,eis_Continental_United_States_Interceptor_Site,convergent,What defines the keep out area in relation to the CIS footprint?,The keep out area is a zone of potential exposure to hazards associated with an actual interceptor launch and is defined based on distance from the interceptor silos.,"ES.2.5 CIS Deployment Alternatives 
The initial CIS deployment alternatives included the following: 
-	FCTC Site 1 and FCTC Site 2, Fort Custer, MI. 
-	CRJMTC Site, Ravenna, OH. 
-	FTD Site, Fort Drum, NY. 
-	SERE East Site, near Rangeley, ME. 
Throughout the EIS, the site layouts were developed and refined and attempts were made to avoid environmental impacts to the maximum extent practicable, especially those related to biological resources, water resources (streams), and wetlands. It is anticipated that if a decision is made to deploy the CIS then MDA will work closely with USACE, USFWS, and the host installation to revise the site design, consistent with mission objectives, to minimize impacts to the greatest extent practicable. 

There are differences in acreage among the sites which result from siting the missile defense complex and associated mission support facilities to maximize operational effectiveness and minimize environmental impacts. For the CIS footprints, the following designations are used to define specific-areas by its function:
-	CIS footprint. The CIS footprint includes the overall area within the candidate site locations that may be used or relates to direct functions of the CIS. The CIS footprint consists of the following sub-areas: missile defense complex, mission support area, and keep-out area. Therefore the total acreages defined throughout the EIS document for the CIS footprint includes the compilation of the acreages from these three areas. With the exception of the ""keep out area"", it has been assumed that the areas within the CIS footprint would be completely cleared of vegetation and graded to provide a level surface for the CIS facilities and required infrastructure.
-	Missile Defense Complex. The missile defense complex consists of the area within the CIS footprint that primarily includes, but is not limited to, the CIS facilities defined in Table ES-1 of Section ES2.3. The area required for the missile defense complex would be completely cleared of vegetation and graded to provide a level surface for the CIS facilities and required infrastructure. 
-	Mission Support Area. The mission support area consists of the area within the CIS footprint that primarily includes, but is not limited to, the CIS facilities defined in Table ES-2 of Section ES.2.3. The mission support area would be completely cleared of vegetation and graded to provide a level surface for the CIS facilities and required infrastructure. 
-	Keep Out Area. The keep out area represents a zone of potential exposure to hazards associated with an actual interceptor launch which would not occur during normal operations but only in the event of an interceptor launch. The keep out area is defined based on distance from the interceptor silos. It would not be necessary to clear, grade, or fence the keep out area. Inhabited buildings would not be located in the keep out area. If the CIS were deployed, the installation would conduct a risk analysis to identify institutional control measures appropriate to ensure safety in the event of an actual interceptor launch. Institutional controls might include signs or other visual or audible warnings. The acreages for the keep out areas are the difference between the total CIS footprint and the total acreages to be cleared. 
With the exception of the SERE East site, the other sites were fully analyzed for affected environments, environmental consequences (potential impacts), and potential mitigation options for the potential deployment of the CIS. A summary of assessments is provided in Sections ES.3.3 through ES.3.6.

With the exception of the ""keep out area"", it has been assumed that the areas within the CIS footprint would be completely cleared of vegetation and graded to provide a level surface for the CIS facilities and required infrastructure.
-	Missile Defense Complex. The missile defense complex consists of the area within the CIS footprint that primarily includes, but is not limited to, the CIS facilities defined in Table ES-1 of Section ES2.3. The area required for the missile defense complex would be completely cleared of vegetation and graded to provide a level surface for the CIS facilities and required infrastructure. 
-	Mission Support Area. The mission support area consists of the area within the CIS footprint that primarily includes, but is not limited to, the CIS facilities defined in Table ES-2 of Section ES.2.3. The mission support area would be completely cleared of vegetation and graded to provide a level surface for the CIS facilities and required infrastructure. 
-	Keep Out Area. The keep out area represents a zone of potential exposure to hazards associated with an actual interceptor launch which would not occur during normal operations but only in the event of an interceptor launch. The keep out area is defined based on distance from the interceptor silos. It would not be necessary to clear, grade, or fence the keep out area. Inhabited buildings would not be located in the keep out area. If the CIS were deployed, the installation would conduct a risk analysis to identify institutional control measures appropriate to ensure safety in the event of an actual interceptor launch. Institutional controls might include signs or other visual or audible warnings. The acreages for the keep out areas are the difference between the total CIS footprint and the total acreages to be cleared. 
With the exception of the SERE East site, the other sites were fully analyzed for affected environments, environmental consequences (potential impacts), and potential mitigation options for the potential deployment of the CIS. A summary of assessments is provided in Sections ES.3.3 through ES.3.6. 
Although an initial analysis of the SERE East Site was completed for affected environment and environmental consequences, as discussed briefly in Section ES.2.7, this site was considered but was not carried forward and not fully analyzed as a potential CIS deployment alternative.

EIS00197,eis_FirstNet,closed,Is Infrastructure only manmade?,yes,"ES-5.1 INFRASTRUCTURE 
Infrastructure consists of the systems and physical structures that enable a population in a specified area to function. Infrastructure is entirely manmade with a high correlation between the type and extent of infrastructure and the degree to which an area is characterized as ""developed."" Infrastructure includes a broad array of facilities such as utility systems, streets and highways, railroads, airports, buildings and structures, ports, harbors, and other manmade facilities. Individuals, businesses, government entities, and virtually all relationships between these groups depend on infrastructure for their most basic needs, as well as for critical and advanced needs (e.g., emergency response, health care, and telecommunications). 
This section describes potential impacts to infrastructure including transportation, communications, and other utilities, associated with deployment and operation of the Preferred Alternative, and discusses some BMPs and mitigation measures that could avoid or minimize those potential impacts (see Table ES5-1). Potential impacts associated with the Deployable Technology Alternative are discussed in Section ES-7.1 (below). 
Summary of Impacts 
Deployment and operation of the Preferred Alternative could potentially impact transportation system safety and capacity through the creation of traffic congestion or delay (e.g., lane closures), or result in the increase in transportation incidents (e.g., crashes, derailments) due to the transport of heavy equipment or deployment activities including plowing, directional boring, and trenching along roadways and within the public road ROWs. The presence of deployable technologies such as COWs, COLTs, SOWs, and Deployable Aerial Communications Architecture has the potential to impact air and land-based traffic congestion and safety. Submarine deployment activities in limited near-shore or inland bodies of water additionally have the potential to increase boat traffic and congestion on a short-term basis. These potential impacts to transportation capacity and safety would be less than significant, as they would likely be short term, would be regionally based around the ongoing phase of deployment, and would return to normal conditions after a few months or less.

EIS00313,eis_Fort_Wainwright_Alaska,closed,Is the CHPP one of the oldest operational coal-fired power plants in the United States?,yes,"Introduction and Background 
This Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) addresses the proposal by the U.S. Army Garrison (USAG) Alaska for implementation of heat and electrical generation and distribution upgrades at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. Fort Wainwright is located in the interior of Alaska, adjacent to Fairbanks, and is home to USAG Alaska and units of the 11th Airborne Division, including the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, U.S. Army Aviation units, and Medical Department Activity-Alaska. To support the readiness of these U.S. Department of the Army (Army) forces, USAG Alaska is dependent on reliable heat and power supplied to more than 400 facilities across the 9 million-square-foot installation. The installation generates the majority of its own heat and most of its electricity by burning coal at a central heat and power plant (CHPP) under a utility privatization contract with the System Owner; the remainder of electricity required for the installation is obtained directly from a local utility provider. 
The CHPP has been in use since 1955, is one of the oldest operational coal-fired power plants in the United States, and is operating approximately 30 years beyond the average design life of similar facilities (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers [USACE] 2012, 2018; SourceWatch 2019). The installation's steam utilidor distribution system for transferring heat throughout the installation is also operating at or beyond its design life (Guernsey 2015). In the last decade, even after investing more than $70 million in system upgrades, the CHPP and the steam distribution system have experienced several separate near-catastrophic failures, most of which halted the plant's ability to generate electricity or provide steam. 
In addition to the existing operational deficiencies, the CHPP has periodically failed to meet state and federal air emissions standards. In January 2018, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) issued a notice of violation to the CHPP's System Owner for exceeding statutory carbon monoxide (CO) emission limits. To meet statutory CO limits and comply with the federal emissions standards, the System Owner is now required to operate CHPP boilers at 20 percent reduced capacity.

This Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) addresses the proposal by the U.S. Army Garrison (USAG) Alaska for implementation of heat and electrical generation and distribution upgrades at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. Fort Wainwright is located in the interior of Alaska, adjacent to Fairbanks, and is home to USAG Alaska and units of the 11th Airborne Division, including the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, U.S. Army Aviation units, and Medical Department Activity-Alaska. To support the readiness of these U.S. Department of the Army (Army) forces, USAG Alaska is dependent on reliable heat and power supplied to more than 400 facilities across the 9 million-square-foot installation. The installation generates the majority of its own heat and most of its electricity by burning coal at a central heat and power plant (CHPP) under a utility privatization contract with the System Owner; the remainder of electricity required for the installation is obtained directly from a local utility provider. 
The CHPP has been in use since 1955, is one of the oldest operational coal-fired power plants in the United States, and is operating approximately 30 years beyond the average design life of similar facilities (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers [USACE] 2012, 2018; SourceWatch 2019). The installation's steam utilidor distribution system for transferring heat throughout the installation is also operating at or beyond its design life (Guernsey 2015). In the last decade, even after investing more than $70 million in system upgrades, the CHPP and the steam distribution system have experienced several separate near-catastrophic failures, most of which halted the plant's ability to generate electricity or provide steam. 
In addition to the existing operational deficiencies, the CHPP has periodically failed to meet state and federal air emissions standards. In January 2018, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) issued a notice of violation to the CHPP's System Owner for exceeding statutory carbon monoxide (CO) emission limits. To meet statutory CO limits and comply with the federal emissions standards, the System Owner is now required to operate CHPP boilers at 20 percent reduced capacity.

EIS00328,eis_Fort_Wainwright_Alaska,closed,Is Alternative 2 a coal-fired CHPP?,no,"Alternative 2: Build New Dual-Fuel Combustion Turbine Generator CHPP. Under Alternative 2, USAG Alaska would replace the existing CHPP with a new, modern, dual-fuel combustion turbine generator CHPP. The system would allow for two online combustion turbine generators (CTGs) to meet summertime peak demands while one is down for maintenance, and two of the heat recovery steam generators to meet peak steam-to-post demands, leaving one for redundancy. The primary fuel for the new plant would be natural gas, with ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) as the secondary source. As with Alternative 1, USAG Alaska would upgrade the steam distribution system and demolish the old CHPP following operational transition. Under this alternative, USAG Alaska would be required to secure a sustained supply of natural gas and ULSD. USAG Alaska would construct a natural gas supply pipeline between an existing natural gas distribution main and the new CHPP. In accordance with Army Directive 2020-03 (Installation Energy and Water Resilience Policy) (Department of Defense [DoD] 2020), USAG Alaska would also construct ULSD fuel storage to maintain a minimum 14-day supply adequate to support facility operations in the event of a substantial energy supply disruption. Among those carried forward for detailed analysis in the EIS, this alternative would enhance fuel source resiliency, be the best environmentally centralized option, and have lower implementation and O&M costs than a coal-fired CHPP (USACE 2018). 
Alternative 3: Install Distributed Natural Gas Boilers. Under Alternative 3, USAG Alaska would transition away from a centralized heat and power model by installing multiple high-efficiency natural gas-fired boilers at facilities dispersed across the installation to provide heat, and would purchase all required electricity from a local utility provider. USAG Alaska would demolish the old CHPP once the distributed natural gas boiler system is operational. Portions of the existing steam distribution system would be upgraded as required to accommodate steam and return water distribution to support the distributed boilers and other underground utilities. USAG Alaska would also be required to secure a sustained natural gas supply to support boiler operations across the installation. In the event of a power outage or natural gas interruption to mission-critical buildings, ULSD-reciprocating combustion generators would be used as emergency backup power or heat sources for boilers. To provide installation-wide electricity resiliency, emergency generators would be placed at the electrical substations on the installation for use in the event of a local-power interruption. Among those carried forward for detailed analysis in the EIS, this alternative would have the lowest implementation and O&M costs, an energy usage reduction of up to 46 percent from current baseline, and the advantage of emergency generators already in place in mission-critical facilities (USACE 2018).

USAG Alaska would continue to use the existing CHPP and utilidor system described in Section 1.1.2 and would not construct any new facilities. Continued reliance on this old plant, controls, and heat distribution system would result in operational and cost inefficiencies, life-safety hazards, and risks to mission sustainability at Fort Wainwright. The existing system operates at about 42 percent efficiency because about 60 percent of fuel energy is lost by the time coal energy is converted to either usable steam energy or useful electricity (Guernsey 2015). To keep the plant operational, USAG Alaska would need to make major repairs and upgrade plant parts and technologies, upgrade approximately 27 miles of old utilidor pipeline, incorporate cost-intensive BACT (implementation costs estimated between $22 million and $235 million [Agrawal 2020]), and continue to operate the derated CHPP boilers at 80 percent of their nameplate-rated capacity to meet air quality emissions regulations and standards. Under the No Action Alternative, the System Owner contractor would continue to invest money in the infrastructure as originally proposed in the contract. This capital investment would allow the System Owner contractor to earn interest on its investment, which is the profit it expected when the contract was executed in 2008. Continuing to operate the existing CHPP at reduced capacity would diminish the existing plant's ability to support the USAG Alaska and 11th Airborne Division missions.

As described for Alternatives 1 and 2, USAG Alaska would continue operation of the existing plant until installation of the new natural gas boilers and construction of the supporting infrastructure is completed and facilities are online, to ensure minimal impacts on the USAG Alaska mission. USAG Alaska would demolish the existing CHPP once construction of the distributed natural gas boiler system is complete. The life cycle cost analysis presented in the USACE 2018 study models Alternative 3 with third party financing cost such as Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) or Utility Energy Service Contract (UESC). 
The existing steam distribution system would be upgraded as required to accommodate steam and return water distribution to support the boilers and other underground utilities such as water and sewer pipes. As described for Alternative 2, USAG Alaska would also purchase a sustained supply of natural gas to support boiler operations across the installation. As described for Alternative 2, the natural gas supply in Alaska is sufficient to meet the installation's demand (Pentex Alaska LLC 2016). Both natural gas and ULSD would be sourced from a utility provider, natural gas would be supplied by a pipeline to the installation, and ULSD would be stored in aboveground tanks located on the installation. In the event of a power outage or natural gas interruption to mission-critical buildings, ULSD-reciprocating internal combustion generators would be used as emergency backup power or heat sources for boilers. To provide installation-wide electricity resiliency, generators would be placed at electrical substations in the event of a local utility-provided power interruption. Through the use of modern technology adequate for operation in subarctic conditions, the new system would meet federal and state environmental regulations and meet air quality standards for the region. The operational carbon footprint of this alternative was assessed in Section 4.2 of the Guernsey (2015) study. If this alternative is selected, the carbon footprint would be refined based on the design parameters and during the Title V permitting process. Based on the heat and electricity studies described in Section 1.1.2, among the alternatives carried forward for detailed analysis in the EIS, this alternative resulted in the lowest implementation and O&M costs, the highest increase in energy efficiency, and the advantage of emergency generators already in place in mission-critical facilities (USACE 2018). Upon the development of a design, further environmental coordination, permitting, and consultation would occur. The need for additional environmental impact analysis would be assessed at that time.

Proposed Action- Fifty-seven sites that are either eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or have yet to be evaluated have been identified within the Direct Area of Potential Effects (APE). All of these sites would be physically altered, resulting in an adverse effect to these cultural sites. Approximately 396 acres of two Properties of Cultural and Religious Importance (PCRIs) are within the Direct APE but would be physically avoided as no new surface disturbance is proposed within the PCRIs. Although no adverse effects are anticipated to the PCRIs, the Project would have an effect from visual changes outside the boundaries of the PCRIs and from (authorized and proposed) mining traffic in the boundaries of the PCRIs. Although there are 347 NRHP-eligible and 109 unevaluated/unknown sites with the Visual APE, none would be directly or indirectly impacted by the Proposed Action. One NRHP-eligible historic site (lime kiln) within the Vibrational APE)would potentially be impacted from increased mining traffic, but this site has previously been mitigated under previous authorizations. No adverse impacts are anticipated for the Shoshone Wells townsite. Adverse impacts to cultural sites would be addressed under the existing September 2018 Programmatic Agreement (PA). Additionally, a Historic Properties Treatment Plan (HPTP) is being developed that addresses mitigation of adverse effects to sites eligible or unevaluated for the NRHP and that would be adversely affected by the Project. 
Wildlife Alternative- The impacts to Cultural Resources under the Wildlife Alternative would be the same as described for the Proposed Action. 
No Action Alternative- Adverse impacts to NRHP-eligible or unevaluated cultural properties resulting from the No Action Alternative are as previously authorized and would be mitigated in accordance with the PA.

Historically, the Western Shoshone were organized in extended family groups identified with loosely defined home districts that were often named for a prominent food source (Cedar Creek 2019a). Other names were derived from geographic features or unique resources. These districts, often bordered by crests of mountains, contained settlement areas that were connected to a particular group of resources. Group names usually changed as the group moved on to other areas during seasonal rounds. After Euro-American contact, Western Shoshone ""band"" names tended to become more permanent.

By the time Euro-American fur traders entered the area (ca. 1826), Western Shoshone territory encompassed approximately one-third of what would become the state of Nevada. Historically, the Western Shoshone were organized in extended family groups identified with loosely defined home districts that were often named for a prominent food source (Cedar Creek 2019a). Other names were derived from geographic features or unique resources. These districts, often bordered by crests of mountains, contained settlement areas that were connected to a particular group of resources. Group names usually changed as the group moved on to other areas during seasonal rounds. After Euro-American contact, Western Shoshone ""band"" names tended to become more permanent. Today, Western Shoshone live on several small reservations and colonies located throughout California, Nevada, and Utah.

Winter encampments are documented on the Humboldt River near Battle Mountain and Beowawe and ceremonial, traditional food collecting, and hunting ranges were not necessarily adjacent to one another. Frequent travel for periodic gatherings and celebrations, cooperative drives, fishing, pine nut harvests, intermarriage, or visits with shamans could last several months or even years and were undertaken as a family unit or by smaller groups. The traveling patterns created an extensive social network across a broad landscape of varied topography. 
3.8.5 Subsistence 
Traditionally, the Western Shoshone were hunter-gatherers. Women primarily were responsible for gathering plants; trapping small animals; preparing the food; and making pottery, baskets, and clothing. The men hunted large game; built the conical huts; and made flaked stone tools, digging sticks, and rabbit skin blankets. Due to the diverse environmental and ecological variability throughout their aboriginal territory, seasonal subsistence methods varied from band to band. Seasonal movement in search of favored gathering and hunting areas was conducted by small family groups from spring through fall. During the winter, several families would gather into villages in relatively warm areas near food caches (Cedar Creek 2019a). In the spring, family groups dispersed from camps located near caches of stored foods that had been exhausted over the winter, to harvest resources as they become available. 
3.8.6 Plant Resources 
Of the many plants gathered in the summer, recent accounts emphasize camas bulbs, yampa roots, and the seeds of Indian ricegrass, stickleaf, and sunflowers. The fall pine nut harvest, which was critical for winter supplies, was second only to fishing in influencing seasonal movement. Medicinal plants include, but are not limited to, willow, desert parsley, ""Indian"" or ""Mormon Tea,"" and ""Doza."" 
3.8.7 Animal Resources 
Golden eagles and bald eagles figure prominently in Western Shoshone mythology as messengers to and from the creator. Feathers were used by shamans, usually as part of the healing ritual. Other birds, including sage grouse, mourning dove, and mockingbirds, were trapped in sagebrush country, and red-winged and yellow-headed blackbirds were trapped near wetlands (Cedar Creek 2019a). Mormon crickets, cicadas, and grasshoppers were collected when abundant. Rabbits were commonly taken in large numbers by communal drives, often associated with the fall pine nut harvest. Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) are rare in the vicinity of the Native American Traditional Values area of analysis; however, they were once the most important large game of Western Shoshone populations. Pronghorn (antelope) were probably the secondranked large game species and were hunted communally by large numbers of participants drawn to locations where antelope shamans resided. Deer hunting among the Western Shoshone, occasional and opportunistic in the past, became more important in proportion to the reduction of other game. The Humboldt fishery was recognized as one of the most important fisheries in the Great Basin, although fishing opportunities were apparently limited (Cedar Creek 2019a).

Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) are rare in the vicinity of the Native American Traditional Values area of analysis; however, they were once the most important large game of Western Shoshone populations. Pronghorn (antelope) were probably the secondranked large game species and were hunted communally by large numbers of participants drawn to locations where antelope shamans resided. Deer hunting among the Western Shoshone, occasional and opportunistic in the past, became more important in proportion to the reduction of other game. The Humboldt fishery was recognized as one of the most important fisheries in the Great Basin, although fishing opportunities were apparently limited (Cedar Creek 2019a).

Winter encampments are documented on the Humboldt River near Battle Mountain and Beowawe and ceremonial, traditional food collecting, and hunting ranges were not necessarily adjacent to one another. Frequent travel for periodic gatherings and celebrations, cooperative drives, fishing, pine nut harvests, intermarriage, or visits with shamans could last several months or even years and were undertaken as a family unit or by smaller groups. The traveling patterns created an extensive social network across a broad landscape of varied topography. 
3.8.5 Subsistence 
Traditionally, the Western Shoshone were hunter-gatherers. Women primarily were responsible for gathering plants; trapping small animals; preparing the food; and making pottery, baskets, and clothing. The men hunted large game; built the conical huts; and made flaked stone tools, digging sticks, and rabbit skin blankets. Due to the diverse environmental and ecological variability throughout their aboriginal territory, seasonal subsistence methods varied from band to band. Seasonal movement in search of favored gathering and hunting areas was conducted by small family groups from spring through fall. During the winter, several families would gather into villages in relatively warm areas near food caches (Cedar Creek 2019a). In the spring, family groups dispersed from camps located near caches of stored foods that had been exhausted over the winter, to harvest resources as they become available. 
3.8.6 Plant Resources 
Of the many plants gathered in the summer, recent accounts emphasize camas bulbs, yampa roots, and the seeds of Indian ricegrass, stickleaf, and sunflowers. The fall pine nut harvest, which was critical for winter supplies, was second only to fishing in influencing seasonal movement. Medicinal plants include, but are not limited to, willow, desert parsley, ""Indian"" or ""Mormon Tea,"" and ""Doza.""

Golden eagles and bald eagles figure prominently in Western Shoshone mythology as messengers to and from the creator. Feathers were used by shamans, usually as part of the healing ritual.

Cumulative effects to wildlife resources would be primarily related directly to habitat loss, habitat degradation, habitat fragmentation including impacts to general wildlife migration corridors (impacts to big game migration corridors are discussed below), and animal displacement. Many of the local wildlife populations that occur in the CESA would continue to occupy their respective ranges; however, as a result of present and RFFAs, wildlife population numbers may decrease relative to habitat loss and disturbance from incremental development. In addition, local bird species would be displaced into neighboring territories, thereby increasing local competition, which can lead to increases in predation, mortality, or lost nesting opportunities. Competition among the remaining resources can limit population health. 
Under the Proposed Action, additional habitat fragmentation and displacement (including impacts to migration corridors) would occur and may decrease the survival rates of affected individuals, increase competition, and impact migration patterns and corridors. Fencing around the RIB galleries could directly impact individual wildlife that get tangled in the fencing, or indirectly from habitat fragmentation or increased predation (from perching avian predators). 
The Project would incrementally increase disturbance to wildlife habitat by an additional 1,694 acres (less than one percent of the CESA) for a total disturbance in the CESA from past, present, and RFFAs of 37,678 acres, or 15 percent of the CESA. Since the Project would add additional noise sources in wildlife habitat from construction and operation of mine infrastructure as well as from traffic, NGM has incorporated soundreduction measures in the engineering design of the Project. Implementation of ACEPMs for the Proposed Action in combination with reclamation would decrease some of the impacts of these past, present, and RFFAs including the Proposed Action throughout the CESA. However, since the collective impacts result in habitat degradation, habitat fragmentation, and displacement from past, present, and RFFAs, impacts to wildlife would be moderate, regional, and long-term to permanent.

The major power transmission lines located within the plan area transfer power generated from the Navajo Generating Station, the Four Corners Generating Station near Fruitland, New Mexico, and the 995-megawatt Cholla coal-fired power plant in northeastern Arizona near Holbrook. An existing 345 kilovolt line connects power generated at the Cholla Generation Plant to the Pinnacle Peak substation, where it is transferred into the 500-kilovolt system for further transmission.

The Tonto National Forest has a long history of hydroelectric production beginning with the Salt River Project and the Childs/Irving Power Plants in the early 1900s. The forest also has the potential to host or facilitate the development of other alternate or renewable energy sources which may include solar, wind, and biomass. Construction and maintenance of facilities and transmission lines could provide employment while energy produced or transmitted provides direct benefits in power generation. Wind and solar energy are clean fuels which do not release hydrocarbons to the atmosphere and as such do not contribute to global warming. 
Interest in exploring renewable energy development on public and private lands, including solar, wind, geothermal, woody biomass, and hydroelectric power at the local, state, and national level, has increased during the past 10 years. In 2006, the Arizona Corporate Commission approved the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff. These rules require that regulated electric utilities must generate 15 percent of their energy from renewable resources by 2025. Each year, Arizona's utility companies are required to file annual implementation plans describing how they will comply with the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff rules. The proposals include incentives for customers who install solar energy technologies for their own homes and businesses. This Renewable Energy Standard, along with Federal direction geared toward energy savings and climate change resiliency, have driven interest in exploring solar, wind, and woody biomass studies directly connected to National Forest System lands which might require development of additional transmission lines on National Forest System lands.

The Tonto National Forest has a long history of hydroelectric production beginning with the Salt River Project and the Childs/Irving Power Plants in the early 1900s. The forest also has the potential to host or facilitate the development of other alternate or renewable energy sources which may include solar, wind, and biomass. Construction and maintenance of facilities and transmission lines could provide employment while energy produced or transmitted provides direct benefits in power generation. Wind and solar energy are clean fuels which do not release hydrocarbons to the atmosphere and as such do not contribute to global warming. 
Interest in exploring renewable energy development on public and private lands, including solar, wind, geothermal, woody biomass, and hydroelectric power at the local, state, and national level, has increased during the past 10 years. In 2006, the Arizona Corporate Commission approved the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff. These rules require that regulated electric utilities must generate 15 percent of their energy from renewable resources by 2025. Each year, Arizona's utility companies are required to file annual implementation plans describing how they will comply with the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff rules. The proposals include incentives for customers who install solar energy technologies for their own homes and businesses. This Renewable Energy Standard, along with Federal direction geared toward energy savings and climate change resiliency, have driven interest in exploring solar, wind, and woody biomass studies directly connected to National Forest System lands which might require development of additional transmission lines on National Forest System lands. Because the Arizona Corporate Commission is anticipated to update its renewable energy portfolio within the next 20 years, the Forest needs to consider potential renewable energy projects on National Forest System lands.

These data indicate that there is a concentration of minority and low-income populations within the analysis area. 
The primary environmental justice communities identified are the Native American communities, persons with disabilities, and low-income communities of all races and ethnicities (table 55). These populations meet the definition of environmental justice communities outlined above as they have a meaningfully greater population in the analysis area than in the adjacent geographic areas. In this case, the analysis area and Arizona as a whole. In Gila and Pinal Counties the Native American population is between 1 and 11 percent greater than the rest of the analysis area population and between 3 and 12 percent greater than the population of Native Americans in the whole state of Arizona (table 33 and figure 17). This makes these communities stand out in terms of having Native American populations that could be considered environmental justice communities. Communities with high populations of persons with one or more disabilities may also be considered an environmental justice population, particularly in Gila, Pinal, and Yavapai Counties (figure 19). Maricopa County, with its large population, falls well below the analysis area for persons with disabilities.

EIS00709,eis_Land_Management_Plan,closed,Are frequent fire regimes associated with perennial grasses and forbs?,yes,"Frequent fire regimes are found where there are combinations of species that can produce sufficient fuel to burn every few years, primarily perennial grasses and forbs that thrive in open conditions; such as grasslands, savannas, or open forests. When fires are frequent, the fuels that are burning are mostly light and flashy, and support fires with short residence times, so little heat is transmitted into the soil or tree boles. Flame lengths on any one spot can vary widely, depending on surface fuels structure and composition, and the conditions under which they burn. In most cases, herbaceous species comprise the majority of the light surface fuels, though litter from overstory species, such as ponderosa pine, can be a critical component. In some frequent fire ecological response units, there are specific conditions where litter from trees and/or shrubs comprises the majority of the surface fuels. In these cases, typical fires would be of slightly lower intensity with a slightly longer residence time. 
Fire and other disturbances maintain a mosaic of seral stages, which shift both temporally and spatially, depending on the ecological response unit and environmental conditions affecting the disturbance. The patch size is also limited by environmental conditions at the time of the disturbance, such as species, fuel structure, current and recent weather, but is also dependent on site-specific variables, such as soil, slope, and aspect. In most places, in most frequent fire ecological response units, woody species are likely to increase when the fire frequency increases. The increased shade decreases the herbaceous component that comprises the light flashy surface fuels. As canopies become more closed in later seral stages, the nature of the fire behavior and effects that are possibly changed, as fuel loads eventually increase to a point that fires that do burn may damage soil, kill overstory trees, and decimate the seed bank. The absence of fire allows the establishment of species that are not fire adapted, prevents species that are fire dependent from thriving, and allows shade tolerant species to establish, and/or species that are present to become overly dense or overrepresented.

This PEIS will aid in understanding and communicating any important environmental impacts that may be associated with decommissioning and inform the decision-making process. 
For the OCS O&G program, lessees and owners of operating rights seeking to decommission their platforms, pipelines, other equipment, facilities, or obstructions must do so in accordance with the governing regulations, principally located at 30 CFR part 250 Subpart Q, and lease terms and conditions. There are currently 23 O&G platforms on the POCS off the southern coast of California (Figure 1-1). The first of these platforms was installed in 1967 and the last two in 1989, and all will eventually be subject to decommissioning. Figure 1-2 depicts the typical structure of an offshore oil platform, such as those existing on the POCS. O&G lessees, owners of operating rights, and holders of ROWs must decommission all POCS wells, platforms, other facilities, and pipelines, and clear the seafloor of all obstructions, in compliance with regulatory requirements. Lessees and owners of operating rights and holders of ROWs must apply for and obtain approval from the appropriate BSEE District Manager or Regional Supervisor before decommissioning wells, platforms, pipelines, and other facilities. 
Decommissioning operations generally occur after lease expiration, when facilities are no longer useful for operations, or when ordered by BSEE consistent with applicable laws and regulations. Currently, eight O&G platforms on the POCS offshore of southern California, near Point Conception and in the Santa Barbara Channel, no longer produce O&G (Table 1-1). These platforms are located on terminated leases that no longer allow resumption of production. Seven of these platforms (Gail, Grace, Harvest, Hermosa, Hidalgo, Hogan, and Houchin) are shut-in,1 1 To ""shut-in"" a well means to close off a well so it is no longer producing. A shut-in platform is one in which all the wells have been closed off and production is no longer occurring at the platform. pending a final decommissioning decision. In addition, Platform Habitat is currently in a state of preservation2 2 At these platforms, ongoing regulatory and statutory requirements for managing platforms following lease termination continue to apply, notably those for maintaining safety and protecting the environment on the OCS. Platform and pipeline maintenance would continue to take place, as would BSEE's inspection program (30 CFR 250.130-250.133). and may proceed to decommissioning within the next 10 years. Well-plugging and conductor-removal operations are underway on some of these platforms, and platform and related facility and pipeline decommissioning are expected to occur this decade.

Table 4.1-1 presents the various decommissioning activities that produce these IPFs. Mitigation measures for relevant IPFs are presented in Table 4.1-3 and the definitions of impact levels are presented in Table 4.1-4. The following sections describe and evaluate the potential consequences of the IPFs under the decommissioning alternatives on air quality. As no decommissioning plans are currently available for any platform within the POCS that could serve as a basis for estimating air emissions from decommissioning, the current analysis constructs a case study involving the complete decommissioning of a large deep-water platform within 20 months. This case study is assumed to represent a high-end level of decommissioning activities that is unlikely to be exceeded in any given year for the purpose of estimating annual air emissions. It should be noted that the majority of actual emissions from decommissioning would ultimately occur in federal waters off of Santa Barbara County, in which 15 of the 23 platforms on the POCS are located. During decommissioning, the number of vessels and equipment and resulting air emissions would depend on platform-specific characteristics, such as location, water depth, and the size and complexities of infrastructure. Consequently, air emissions at different platforms would vary according to the different types and sizes of equipment, lift cranes, barges, and tugboats required, some with varying levels of emission control systems. The local air districts will regulate air emissions from stationary sources, and the CARB will regulate air emissions from marine vessels. CARB's requirements will include propulsion engine operation monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting, as well as the use of ULSD fuel with a sulfur content of 15 ppm or less (see Section 3.2.6), and limits on visible emissions. Operators will also be required to comply with CARB standards for new and modified engines. Mitigation in the future will require reducing diesel emissions and would include use of zero-emission technologies to the fullest extent feasible. Section 176(c) (42 U.S.C. 7506) of the CAA requires federal agencies' actions to conform to any applicable state, tribal, or federal implementation plans (SIP, TIP, FIP, respectively) for attaining and maintaining the NAAQS.

Table 4.1-1 presents the various decommissioning activities that produce these IPFs. Mitigation measures for relevant IPFs are presented in Table 4.1-3 and the definitions of impact levels are presented in Table 4.1-4. The following sections describe and evaluate the potential consequences of the IPFs under the decommissioning alternatives on air quality. As no decommissioning plans are currently available for any platform within the POCS that could serve as a basis for estimating air emissions from decommissioning, the current analysis constructs a case study involving the complete decommissioning of a large deep-water platform within 20 months. This case study is assumed to represent a high-end level of decommissioning activities that is unlikely to be exceeded in any given year for the purpose of estimating annual air emissions. It should be noted that the majority of actual emissions from decommissioning would ultimately occur in federal waters off of Santa Barbara County, in which 15 of the 23 platforms on the POCS are located. During decommissioning, the number of vessels and equipment and resulting air emissions would depend on platform-specific characteristics, such as location, water depth, and the size and complexities of infrastructure. Consequently, air emissions at different platforms would vary according to the different types and sizes of equipment, lift cranes, barges, and tugboats required, some with varying levels of emission control systems. The local air districts will regulate air emissions from stationary sources, and the CARB will regulate air emissions from marine vessels. CARB's requirements will include propulsion engine operation monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting, as well as the use of ULSD fuel with a sulfur content of 15 ppm or less (see Section 3.2.6), and limits on visible emissions.

EIS00919,eis_PEIS_for_Oil_and_Gas,closed,Has the Pacific Coast Fisheries Management Council ever recommended any offshore platforms for HAPC designation?,yes,"Although platforms are not considered EFH, the Pacific Coast Fisheries Management Council had in the past recommended that 13 of the 23 offshore platforms in federal waters be designated as Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (PFMC 2005). The platforms recommended for Habitat Area of Particular Concern (HAPC) designation were Platform A, Platform B, Platform C, and Platforms Edith, Gail, Gilda, Grace, Habitat, Harvest, Hermosa, Hidalgo, Hondo, and Irene (PFMC 2005). Although the HAPC designations were not approved by the NOAA, the recommendation suggests the high ecological value of some platform habitats. In assessing the effects of platform removal, it is important to consider the value of artificial reef habitats compared to natural reefs, more specifically whether reefs contribute to the production of fish rather than simply attracting fish. Claisse et al. (2014) found platforms to have the highest secondary production per unit of seafloor of any marine habitat. Several studies have also found that platforms contribute to the production of certain fish species in California, namely rockfish, which often have higher densities on platforms than natural reefs (Love et al. 2012). Similarly, several studies of individual platforms have shown that rockfish grow as fast or faster at platforms compared to natural reefs, although for other species platforms are not considered to make a substantial contribution to the regional stocks (Love 2019). In one of the few modeling studies, the removal of Platform Gail was estimated to be equivalent to removing between 12.6 and 29 hectares (31 and 72 ac) of natural habitat for bocaccio and cowcod (Scarborough Bull and Love 2019). In addition, larval dispersal studies indicate that platforms are important local recruitment sites for some rockfish species in areas where there is little natural reef habitat, providing up to 20% of average recruitment for some species (Scarborough Bull and Love 2019). However, the connectivity of fish populations between offshore platforms and natural reefs is not well understood for most species, so it is difficult to assess the consequences of platform removal for larval dispersal and recruitment."

EIS00932,eis_PEIS_for_Oil_and_Gas,closed,Is the average reduction in fish biomass due to partial platform jacket removal 10%?,yes,"Impacts from partial jacket removal will also vary by platform. Based on modeling data from 24 platforms, partial removal to 26 m (85 ft) depth resulted in an average of 10% reduction in fish biomass and an 8% reduction in somatic production. Across the 23 platforms, fish biomass loss ranged from 0% to 44% and from 0% to 48% for somatic fish production (MeyerGutbrod et al. 2020). As expected, the differences between the platforms are related to depth and structural configuration, with the shallowest platforms experiencing the greatest losses and platforms in deeper water retaining most of the fish assemblage. Therefore, while there would be a loss of fish residing in the upper portions of the platform structure, they are generally a small portion of the total fish community, most of which reside near the platform bottom (Claisse et al. 2015; Meyer-Gutbrod et al. 2020). Consequently, most fish would not be affected by the removal of the upper portion of the platform, unless located in shallow water (Claisse et al. 2015; MeyerGutbrod et al. 2019). Overall, partial platform jackets are likely to remain highly productive compared to many other marine habitats (Love et al. 2012; Claisse et al. 2015). 
Under Alternative 2, shell mounds would not be excavated. However, partial removal would take the greatest shell-producing section of the platform jacket, and fish abundance may decrease over time if there is a prominent decline in organic matter subsidies from the platform jacket (Page et al. 2005; de Wit 2001 [cited in Love 2019]; Meyer-Gutbrod et al. 2019). Shellproducing invertebrates are found on platform jackets below 26 m (85 ft) so inputs may continue to a lesser extent even after partial jacket removal. Therefore, the shell mound habitat may persist depending on local currents and sedimentation rates, as well as the magnitude of the reduction in mussel production (Claisse et al. 2015; Meyer-Gutbrod et al. 2020). Studies indicate that even shell mounds at locations where platforms were completely removed at the seafloor 30 years prior continued to have shell mound fish communities (similar to natural rocky reef habitat) and also had greater diversity and abundance of fish and their invertebrate food sources compared to surrounding softbottom habitat (Page et al. 2005; Krause et al. 2012). The largest shell mounds, typically found in waters shallower than 106.7 m (350 ft), may persist longer than mounds in deeper waters which are smaller and more widely dispersed around the platform (Meyer-Gutbrod et al. 2019; Love 2019).

Based on modeling data from 24 platforms, partial removal to 26 m (85 ft) depth resulted in an average of 10% reduction in fish biomass and an 8% reduction in somatic production. Across the 23 platforms, fish biomass loss ranged from 0% to 44% and from 0% to 48% for somatic fish production (MeyerGutbrod et al. 2020). As expected, the differences between the platforms are related to depth and structural configuration, with the shallowest platforms experiencing the greatest losses and platforms in deeper water retaining most of the fish assemblage. Therefore, while there would be a loss of fish residing in the upper portions of the platform structure, they are generally a small portion of the total fish community, most of which reside near the platform bottom (Claisse et al. 2015; Meyer-Gutbrod et al. 2020). Consequently, most fish would not be affected by the removal of the upper portion of the platform, unless located in shallow water (Claisse et al. 2015; MeyerGutbrod et al. 2019).

Shellproducing invertebrates are found on platform jackets below 26 m (85 ft) so inputs may continue to a lesser extent even after partial jacket removal. Therefore, the shell mound habitat may persist depending on local currents and sedimentation rates, as well as the magnitude of the reduction in mussel production (Claisse et al. 2015; Meyer-Gutbrod et al. 2020). Studies indicate that even shell mounds at locations where platforms were completely removed at the seafloor 30 years prior continued to have shell mound fish communities (similar to natural rocky reef habitat) and also had greater diversity and abundance of fish and their invertebrate food sources compared to surrounding softbottom habitat (Page et al. 2005; Krause et al. 2012). The largest shell mounds, typically found in waters shallower than 106.7 m (350 ft), may persist longer than mounds in deeper waters which are smaller and more widely dispersed around the platform (Meyer-Gutbrod et al. 2019; Love 2019).

Based on modeling data from 24 platforms, partial removal to 26 m (85 ft) depth resulted in an average of 10% reduction in fish biomass and an 8% reduction in somatic production. Across the 23 platforms, fish biomass loss ranged from 0% to 44% and from 0% to 48% for somatic fish production (MeyerGutbrod et al. 2020). As expected, the differences between the platforms are related to depth and structural configuration, with the shallowest platforms experiencing the greatest losses and platforms in deeper water retaining most of the fish assemblage. Therefore, while there would be a loss of fish residing in the upper portions of the platform structure, they are generally a small portion of the total fish community, most of which reside near the platform bottom (Claisse et al. 2015; Meyer-Gutbrod et al. 2020). Consequently, most fish would not be affected by the removal of the upper portion of the platform, unless located in shallow water (Claisse et al. 2015; MeyerGutbrod et al. 2019). Overall, partial platform jackets are likely to remain highly productive compared to many other marine habitats (Love et al. 2012; Claisse et al. 2015). 
Under Alternative 2, shell mounds would not be excavated. However, partial removal would take the greatest shell-producing section of the platform jacket, and fish abundance may decrease over time if there is a prominent decline in organic matter subsidies from the platform jacket (Page et al. 2005; de Wit 2001 [cited in Love 2019]; Meyer-Gutbrod et al. 2019). Shellproducing invertebrates are found on platform jackets below 26 m (85 ft) so inputs may continue to a lesser extent even after partial jacket removal. Therefore, the shell mound habitat may persist depending on local currents and sedimentation rates, as well as the magnitude of the reduction in mussel production (Claisse et al. 2015; Meyer-Gutbrod et al. 2020). Studies indicate that even shell mounds at locations where platforms were completely removed at the seafloor 30 years prior continued to have shell mound fish communities (similar to natural rocky reef habitat) and also had greater diversity and abundance of fish and their invertebrate food sources compared to surrounding softbottom habitat (Page et al. 2005; Krause et al. 2012). The largest shell mounds, typically found in waters shallower than 106.7 m (350 ft), may persist longer than mounds in deeper waters which are smaller and more widely dispersed around the platform (Meyer-Gutbrod et al. 2019; Love 2019). If there is a decline in shell mound habitat quality over time, fish species requiring low-relief reef habitat will move to other areas and fish productivity at the platform site may decrease.

EIS01015,eis_Sea_Port_Oil_Terminal,funnel,What potential environmental impacts could pipeline construction have on groundwater resources?,"Potential environmental impacts include indirect effects from changes in overland sheet flow, compaction reducing soil water absorption, affecting aquifer recharge, and adding impervious surfaces at terminal facilities.","Pipeline Construction
Project construction would not substantially affect groundwater resources because the majority of construction would include shallow, temporary excavation for the pipeline trench. Surficial aquifers and aquifer recharge areas could sustain indirect effects from changes in overland sheet flow due to clearing and grading of the workspace. Heavy construction equipment, including equipment used for clearing and grading the right-of-way, could cause compaction and could reduce the ability of soils to absorb water in some areas, thus affecting the ability and/or speed in which water enters the aquifer. The addition of impervious surfaces at the terminal facilities could also affect recharge areas within the boundaries of the facilities.
Trenches for onshore pipeline installation would be excavated using a track-mounted excavator or similar equipment to a depth sufficient to allow a minimum of 3 feet of cover (unless otherwise specified) between the top of the pipe and the final land surface after backfilling. Following construction, the Applicant would restore the ground surface contours as closely as possible to preconstruction conditions and would revegetate the right-of-way to ensure restoration of preconstruction overland flow and recharge patterns in accordance with the Applicant's Construction BMPs (Appendix M; BMP #1 in Appendix N, List of Applicant's Best Management Practices and Agency Recommended Mitigation Measures). Additionally, in agricultural, residential, and wetland areas, the Applicant would decompact subsoil via plow or other deep tillage methods before replacing topsoil (BMP #1), which would allow water to percolate through the soils.
In areas where groundwater is near the surface, trench excavation may intersect the water table. If groundwater enters the trench to the extent trench dewatering is required, dewatering of the trench would result in a temporary fluctuation or drawdown of the groundwater in that area. When trench dewatering is necessary, filter bags, silt fencing, or hay bale structures would be used to minimize the potential for erosion or sedimentation, and trench water would be released into well-vegetated upland areas where it would be reabsorbed, in accordance with the Applicant's Construction BMPs (Appendix M; BMP #1 in Appendix N). The discharged groundwater would filter back through the soil to enter the groundwater system again. In addition, the Applicant would require contractors to use drip pans for all heavy equipment stored overnight in the Project workspace (BMP #32 in Appendix N).

EIS01039,eis_Sea_Port_Oil_Terminal,closed,Does the SPOT DWP convert open water habitat to an artificial reef-like habitat?,yes,"During operation, the SPOT DWP would convert open water habitat to an artificial reef-like habitat in the marine environment and would likely function as a fish aggregating device (FAD) that attracts fish by providing a place for them to congregate. FADs are purposely deployed to draw pelagic fish to targeted areas by commercial, recreational, and artisanal fishers (Fisheries and Aquaculture 2010). The SPOT DWP would provide a suitable environment for encrusting organisms such as algae and invertebrates to attach, thereby providing a food source and shelter for fish. Oil and gas platforms support substantial coral communities in the northern GoM. Platforms provide settlement cues for demersal and reef fish, increasing the likelihood of settlement and recruitment on the newly added structure (Sammarco et al. 2014). As epibenthic7 species begin to recolonize, other larger fish would likely be attracted to the new habitat because it would provide prey, shelter, and potential spawning habitat (Andersson et al. 2009). This potentially beneficial impact spreading across the trophic levels is known as the ""reef effect"" (Langhamer 2012). While the reef effect may be beneficial to some species, it could have adverse impacts on other species, potentially increasing their risk of predation (Copping et al. 2016). Further, it remains unclear what the effects of FADs are on highly migratory species (Snodgrass et al. 2020).

As epibenthic7 species begin to recolonize, other larger fish would likely be attracted to the new habitat because it would provide prey, shelter, and potential spawning habitat (Andersson et al. 2009). This potentially beneficial impact spreading across the trophic levels is known as the ""reef effect"" (Langhamer 2012). While the reef effect may be beneficial to some species, it could have adverse impacts on other species, potentially increasing their risk of predation (Copping et al. 2016). Further, it remains unclear what the effects of FADs are on highly migratory species (Snodgrass et al. 2020). As the footprint of the converted habitat is small in comparison to the available surrounding habitat, impacts on fisheries would be direct, both adverse and beneficial (depending on the species), long-term, and negligible."
EIS01051,eis_Sea_Port_Oil_Terminal,divergent,How might the introduction of artificial reef-like habitats affect the behavior and migration patterns of highly migratory species in the long term?,"The introduction of artificial reef-like habitats could change the behavior and migration patterns of highly migratory species by providing new shelters and food sources, attracting these species to the new area, which might alter their natural paths. On the other hand, it could also disrupt natural migrations by creating ecological traps or leading to increased predation risks.","During operation, the SPOT DWP would convert open water habitat to an artificial reef-like habitat in the marine environment and would likely function as a fish aggregating device (FAD) that attracts fish by providing a place for them to congregate.

Short-term refers to the total duration of onshore and offshore construction of the proposed SPOT Project. Long-term refers to a prolonged period following decommissioning of the proposed Project. Short-term operational activities may result in persistent impacts over a longer period. Construction and the eventual removal of new structures would cause minor impacts in the short-term, which would be limited to the immediate vicinity of the activity; impacts of decommissioning may last longer because of minor elements that would be left in place. Short-term use may have long-term impacts on biologically sensitive offshore areas or archaeological resources. Upon completion of Project construction, the marine environment would generally be expected to remain at or return to its normal long-term productivity levels.
The proposed Project would be located in the GoM approximately 27.2 to 30.8 nautical miles off the coast of Brazoria County, Texas. This area is one of the most important energy producing areas in the United States. Approximately 17 percent of total U.S. crude oil production comes from the GoM and 45 percent of the total refining capacity in the United States is located along the Gulf Coast. Approximately 5 percent of offshore natural gas production occurs in the GoM, and 51 percent of the total natural gas processing capacity is located along the Gulf Coast (EIA 2019e). The area surrounding the proposed SPOT Project supports the oil and gas industry, marine commerce and shipping, commercial and recreational fishing, area ports, and other uses. Project construction is likely to have little impact on long-term productivity of the OCS, because this area already experiences heavy use and vessel traffic, and construction-related activity would constitute a short-term, incremental increase in existing activity.
Project operation would result in long-term impacts within Galveston Area lease blocks A-59 and 463, and would result in an incremental increase in ocean use and marine traffic between Freeport, Texas and the lease blocks. No available data or studies indicate that use of the Project area would cause long-term losses in productivity in the oil and gas, marine commerce and shipping, commercial and recreational fishing, or other related industries, although such losses are possible.
