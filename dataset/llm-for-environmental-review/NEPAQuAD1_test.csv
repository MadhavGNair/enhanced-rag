The DFLAW approach will separate and pretreat some of the tank waste (approximately 23.5 million gallons) from certain underground tanks at the Hanford Site and immobilize (vitrify in a glass matrix) the pretreated LAW at the LAW Vitrification Facility. The DFLAW approach is a two-phased approach that will separate and pretreat supernate (essentially the upper-most layer of tank waste that contains low concentrations of long-lived radionuclides) from some of the Hanford tanks, to generate a LAW stream. Phase 1 of the DFLAW approach will entail the following: in-tank settling; separation (removal by decanting) of the supernate (including dissolved saltcake and interstitial liquids); filtration; and then cesium removal using ion exchange columns in a tank-side cesium removal (TSCR) unit. For Phase 2, DOE plans to treat additional supernate (including dissolved saltcake and interstitial liquids) using the same processes and will deploy either an additional TSCR unit or construct a filtration and cesium removal facility. Facilities and equipment necessary to implement the DFLAW approach include: the Effluent Management Facility; a TSCR unit and either an additional TSCR unit or a filtration and cesium removal facility; additional transfer lines; and a storage pad for cesium ion exchange columns (IX Column Storage Pad).

EIS01214,closed,Does the transportation safety of LLW and MLLW directly depend on the external dose rates of the waste packages?,"Proper packaging is a key element in transportation safety, and the selection of appropriate packaging typically is based on the level and form of radioactivity inherent to the materials that are being shipped. LLW and MLLW must be packaged to protect workers and the public (as well as the environment) during transport due to potential radiological exposures of truck crews and the public being directly dependent upon external dose rates associated with the waste packages.24 Solid and liquid secondary LLW and MLLW to be shipped offsite for treatment and stabilization are expected to have low levels of radioactivity. This is substantiated by the following considerations: (1) the WM PEIS (from which this SA's dose-rate estimates are scaled) conservatively assumed a generically representative dose rate of 1 mrem per hour at 1 meter for all LLW and MLLW packages; (2) recent historical (2-year) measured dose-rate data for LLW and MLLW packages shipped from the Hanford Site exhibited quantities that are comparable to, but smaller than (i.e., on the order of 0.5 mrem per hour at 1 meter) the WM PEIS's general estimate of 1 mrem per hour in the vast majority (i.e., greater than 97 percent) of cases (WRPS 2022b); and (3) MicroShield calculations performed for EMF-concentrate have shown that associated shipping containers (""supertainers"") for liquid MLLW would have an expected dose rate of approximately 0.63 mrem per hour at 2 meters and approximately 9 mrem per hour on contact (WRPS 2022c). Although such a case (0.63 mrem per hour at 2 meters and 9 mrem per hour on contact) would be expected to yield an equivalent dose rate of approximately 2.5 mrem per hour at 1 meter, this value would still result in conditionsfar below allowable USDOT 49 CFR Part 173 limitsfor radiological shipping packages. It is furthermore noteworthy to emphasize that since these Group 3 supertainer shipments would only account for about onethird of the proposed total shipping-miles (e.g., roughly 36 percent for truck crews) for all secondary waste groups evaluated in this SA, that the preponderance of Group 1 and 2 wastes that will be expected to exhibit dose rates in the 0.5 mrem per hour range (at 1 meter) would resultantly bring the overall weighted dose-rate average for the entire collective cadre of shipments down to near the 1 mrem per hour (at 1 meter) mark, which is consistent with the WM PEIS's representative estimate."

Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time."" The TC&WM EIS presented the cumulative impacts analysis in Chapter 6, specifically identifying the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions relative to that proposed action. This chapter evaluates the incremental impacts of implementing the Proposed Action to treat and potentially dispose of secondary waste in licensed and permitted commercial facilities and those evaluated in the TC&WM EIS. The chapter also evaluates if there are any new past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future actions that were not considered in the TC&WM EIS that could contribute to cumulative impacts with the incremental impacts of secondary waste management."

DOE prepared this SA in accordance with 10 CFR 1021.314. The Proposed Action evaluated in the TC&WM EIS acknowledged that secondary waste could be managed through a combination of onsite and offsite treatment capabilities. The TC&WM EIS analyzed the disposal of grouted secondary waste at the IDF. DOE has been implementing a moderate amount of offsite treatment (an average of 73 to 145 cubic meters per year of dangerous waste and MLLW) and disposal since publication of the 2013 ROD. The increased volume of offsite treatment and disposal of LLW and MLLW under the Proposed Action evaluated in this SA would not represent a substantive change relevant to environmental concerns from the Proposed Action evaluated in the TC&WM EIS. The TC&WM EIS evaluated potential environmental impacts from the emission of criteria pollutants, toxic pollutants, and carbon dioxide.
The TC&WM EIS assumed that three onsite waste management facilities (Central Waste Complex, Waste Receiving and Processing, and Tplant) would be expanded because it was uncertain which facility would ultimately house the grouting capability. This analysis provided a conservative evaluation of potential impacts (e.g., land disturbance, air quality, waste management), since it is highly unlikely that all three facilities would be expanded for this function.

The TC&WM EIS assumed that three onsite waste management facilities (Central Waste Complex, Waste Receiving and Processing, and Tplant) would be expanded because it was uncertain which facility would ultimately house the grouting capability. This analysis provided a conservative evaluation of potential impacts (e.g., land disturbance, air quality, waste management), since it is highly unlikely that all three facilities would be expanded for this function. The incremental increase in emissions related to the transportation of secondary waste for treatment and disposal would add less than 1 percent to the values presented in the TC&WM EIS."

In a Strategic Basing Decision Memorandum for Record dated February 16, 2018, the Secretary of the Air Force identified JBSA-Randolph as the preferred alternative and Columbus, Laughlin, Sheppard, and Vance AFBs as reasonable alternatives for T-7A recapitalization. DAF pilot training relies on a unique runway structure and special use airspace (SUA) capable of supporting high volume pilot training. As such, the potential locations for T-7A aircraft are limited to the five existing pilot training installations. DAF evaluated each of the five installations using criteria that included mission factors (e.g., weather and the ability to meet syllabus requirements), infrastructure capacity, and potential environmental constraints and costs. JBSA-Randolph was selected as the preferred alternative and the first installation to undergo recapitalization because it provides the majority of instructor pilot training and is an Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) location. Recapitalizing JBSA-Randolph would serve as an essential first step in establishing a T-7A instructor pilot pipeline and would set the conditions to transition to T-7A training at the other four pilot training installations (DAF 2018).
On January 29, 2021, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force approved the preferred sequencing and locations for the next four installations to possibly undergo T-7A recapitalization. Acting on AETC recommendations, the Acting Secretary selected Columbus AFB to be the second installation to be analyzed environmentally for possible recapitalization. Recapitalizing Columbus AFB second would result in the least impact on continued pilot production during the transition between aircraft types, provide the most efficient cost and student production and management plan, and align with AETC's student pipeline flow for the Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) and IFF curricula.

Maximum noise levels associated with common construction equipment at 50 feet generally range from 73 dB for a power generator to 101 dB for a pile driver. 5 With multiple types of equipment operating concurrently, noise levels can be higher within several hundred feet of active construction and demolition areas. DoD Instruction 4715.13, DoD Operational Noise Program, does not indicate a threshold of significance for construction noise impacts. This instruction does not reference other construction noise guidance; therefore, this analysis refers to Federal Highway Administration guidance for evaluating construction noise. Federal Highway Administration policy considers an hourly Equivalent Sound Level (Leq(h)) of 67 dB an exterior impact for residential and recreational uses (23 CFR Part 772, Table 1)."

EIS01401,closed,Are floodplains along rivers subject to periodic inundation?,"Floodplains.
Floodplains are low-level areas along rivers, stream channels, large wetlands, or coastal waters. Such lands might be subject to periodic or infrequent inundation due to rain or melting snow. Floodplain ecosystem functions include natural moderation of floods, flood storage and conveyance, groundwater recharge, and nutrient cycling.
The risk of flooding typically depends on local topography, the frequency of precipitation events, and the size of the watershed above the floodplain. Flood potential is evaluated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which defines 100- and 500-year floodplains. The 100-year floodplain is an area that has a 1 percent chance of inundation by a flood event in a given year, while 500-year floodplains have a 0.2 percent chance of inundation in a given year. Certain facilities inherently pose too great a risk to be in either the 100- or 500-year floodplain, such as hospitals, schools, or storage buildings for irreplaceable records. Federal, state, and local regulations often limit floodplain development to passive uses, such as recreational and preservation activities, to reduce the risks to human health and safety.
EO 11988, Floodplain Management, requires federal agencies to determine whether a proposed action would occur within a floodplain. This determination typically involves review of FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps, which contain enough general information to determine the relationship of the project area to nearby floodplains.

EIS01411,convergent,What is the likelihood of a 500-year floodplain being inundated in a given year?,"Floodplains.
Floodplains are low-level areas along rivers, stream channels, large wetlands, or coastal waters. Such lands might be subject to periodic or infrequent inundation due to rain or melting snow. Floodplain ecosystem functions include natural moderation of floods, flood storage and conveyance, groundwater recharge, and nutrient cycling.
The risk of flooding typically depends on local topography, the frequency of precipitation events, and the size of the watershed above the floodplain. Flood potential is evaluated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which defines 100- and 500-year floodplains. The 100-year floodplain is an area that has a 1 percent chance of inundation by a flood event in a given year, while 500-year floodplains have a 0.2 percent chance of inundation in a given year. Certain facilities inherently pose too great a risk to be in either the 100- or 500-year floodplain, such as hospitals, schools, or storage buildings for irreplaceable records. Federal, state, and local regulations often limit floodplain development to passive uses, such as recreational and preservation activities, to reduce the risks to human health and safety.
EO 11988, Floodplain Management, requires federal agencies to determine whether a proposed action would occur within a floodplain. This determination typically involves review of FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps, which contain enough general information to determine the relationship of the project area to nearby floodplains.

Impacts to Native American Traditional Values are further discussed throughout several values subsections under Section 4.8 of the EIS."
EIS01582,comparison,What is the difference in the impact level on access to Mount Tenabo/White Cliffs PCRI and Horse Canyon PCRI as expressed in the EIS?,"Environmental Justice populations are analyzed for impacts based on a two-step process per USEPA guidance. In order to assess the potential for significant environmental justice effects, the socioeconomic characteristics of the area of analysis are first screened for the presence of minority and/or low-income populations. Second, if such populations are found to be present based on USEPA's environmental justice guidance (USEPA 1998), the proposed project and alternatives are evaluated for potential effects that may be expected to disproportionately affect any of the identified populations. Furthermore, per Section 4.8.1.2 of the EIS, under the Proposed Action, NGM would construct the Mount Tenabo access road which would allow continued access to the Cortez Range and to locations within Horse Canyon. This road would provide continued access to Mount Tenabo throughout the life of the Goldrush Mine and following reclamation. Public access through the Horse Canyon PCRI would be limited; however NGM would allow access through Horse Canyon Road upon request of the Tribes for cultural purposes. Impacts to access to the Mount Tenabo/White Cliffs PCRI and Horse Canyon PCRI would be negligible to minor, long-term, and localized.
Although there are several concerns listed here, there are no new specific concerns regarding the project. Tribal coordination is ongoing throughout the NEPA process. Coordination meetings, in addition to consultations letters, and other communications have been held between the BLM and Tribes following Project Initiation as discussed in Section 5.2 of the EIS and in the Native American Traditional Values SER.
