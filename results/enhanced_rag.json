This EIS evaluates the \npotential environmental impacts from the potential future deployment of a Continental United \nStates (CONUS) Interceptor Site (CIS) capable of protecting the homeland against threats \nfrom nations, such as North Korea and Iran. If deployed, the CIS would extend the existing \nGround-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System \n(BMDS). The existing Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) sites at Fort Greely, A K, and \nVandenberg Air Force Base, CA, provide the capability to protect the United States (U.S.) \nfrom the current and projected North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) threat, \nas well as a future Iranian ICBM threat should it emerge. \nES.1.2 Purpose and Need  \nThe 2013 NDAA requires MDA to prepare this EIS to evaluate possible additional locations \nin the U.S. best suited for future deployment of an interceptor capable of protecting the \nhomeland against threats from nations such as North Korea and Iran. Per the NDAA, at least \ntwo of these locations considered shall be on the East Coast of the U.S.  \nAn additional site located within CONUS would add potential battle space and interceptor \ncapacity; however, the Department of Defense (DoD) does not propose and has not made a \ndecision to deploy or construct an additional interceptor site. \nES.1.3 Decisions to be Made \nThe decisions to be made are whether and where to deploy a CIS. This EIS considers and \nevaluates a No Action Alternative (no CIS deployment) and three potential CIS deployment \nalternative locations in Michigan, Ohio, and New York. Any deployment decision would be \nbased on the analysis of the ballistic missile threat to the U.S., system performance and \noperational effectiveness, site constructability, cost, and potential environmental impacts. \nBecause MDA has no current proposal or direction to deploy a CIS, its preferred alternative is \nthe No Action Alternative. \nES.1.4 Scope \nof the Environmental Impact Statement \nFor the potential CIS, a siting process was conducted that narrowed the number of sites \ndefined from 457 Department of Defense owned locations throughout the Continental United \nFinal CIS EIS\nFebruary 2017"

Because there is no DoD \nproposal or decision to deploy a CIS, only recommended mitigation options and no formal \nconsultations were conducted with regulatory agencies. Formal regulatory agencies \nconsultations and the determination of specific mitigation options to be implemented would \nbe determined during the permitting phase, if a future decision to deploy is made. \nThe evaluation of the affected environment for each of the candidate sites and each respective \nresource is summarized in the following sections . The potential CIS deployment concept was \nthen applied to each candidate site location to analyze the environmental consequences , \nimpacts, and mitigation options, as identified. A comparative summary table of the impacts \nand potential mitigation options to address impacts is provided following the summary of \naffected environment for all the candidate sites. \nPotential environmental impacts are categorized as negligible, minor, moderate, and major . \nNegligible, minor, and moderate impacts would not be considered significant; however, some \nmajor impacts could be considered significant and are identified in the discussion of specific \nresources. \nES.3.2 No Action \nAlternative – Preferred Alternative \nAs required by the CEQ, the No Action Alternative was evaluated for the EIS. Under this \nalternative the MDA would not deploy or construct an additional CIS. Because no deployment \n(construction, operation, or decommissioning/disposal) activities would be conducted under \nthe No Action Alternatives, no impacts would occur and no mitigations would be required. \nDue to the lack of impacts and potential mitigation options for the No Action Alternative, the \nNo Action Alternative has not been provided in the comparative summary table for the \ncandidate site alternatives (end of Section ES.3.0 ). Because MDA has no current proposal or \ndirection to deploy a CIS, its preferred alternative is the No Action Alternative. \nES.3.3 FCTC Sites (FCTC Site 1\n and FCTC Site 2) \nThe FCTC installation has two potential candidate sites, FCTC Site 1 and FCTC Site 2, for \nthe potential deployment of the CIS. This section provides a description of both of the \ncandidate sites and a summary of the affected environment, by resources evaluated. Because \nsome of the descriptive information for affected environment is similar for both sites, a \ndetailed summary of descriptive information is provided first for FCTC Site 1, and then it is \nFinal CIS EIS\nFebruary 2017"
