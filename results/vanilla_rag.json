        "groundtruth_context": "ES.1.6 Coordination with Regulatory Agencies In addition to public participation, federal and state regulatory agency participation has also been solicited throughout the EIS process. Although no formal consultations have been conducted, informal status meetings and solicitation of input were conducted as follows: \n-\tFCTC Sites (FCTC Site 1 and FCTC Site 2): April 30, 2014 at FCTC and October 14, 2015, at Lansing, MI. During these meetings, federal and state agencies in attendance included U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and Michigan Department of Transportation. \n-\tCRJMTC Site: April 24, 2014, and October 16, 2015, at Columbus, OH. During these meetings, federal and state agencies in attendance included USFWS, USACE, USEPA, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, and Ohio State Historic Preservation Office. In addition to these meetings, MDA personnel conducting the CIS specific transportation study also had meetings with the Ohio Department of Transportation (January 26, 2015). \n-\tFTD Site: April 4, 2014, and November 3, 2015, at Fort Drum, NY. During these meetings, federal and state agencies in attendance included USFWS, USACE, USEPA, New York State Department of Environmental Quality, and New York State Department of Transportation. \n-\tSERE East Site: May 15, 2014, at Augusta, ME; August 19, 2015, at Augusta, ME, with the Maine Historic Preservation Commission and the National Parks Services; and November 5, 2015, at Augusta, ME. During these meetings, federal and state agencies in attendance included USFWS, USACE, USEPA, Maine Department of Environmental Protection, Maine Inland Fish and Wildlife Service, Maine Department of Transportation, Maine State Historic Preservation Office, and Maine Land Use Planning Commission. \n-\tFederal Agencies (Boston, MA): April 23, 2015, and November 4, 2015. During these meetings, federal agencies in attendance included USEPA and USACE. \nDuring these meetings one of the major issues discussed was whether formal consultations would be part of the CIS EIS process. Based on discussions held and due to status of the deployment of the CIS being only \" potential\" at this time, it was agreed that formal consultations with agencies, in specific those requiring potential mitigation would not be held during the EIS process, but that these discussions would be held during the permitting phase once a decision had been made to deploy the CIS and a site for the CIS had been selected. A summary of the comments obtained from the agencies are provided in the Scoping Report on MDA's website: https://www.mda.mil. Informal meeting comments are not included in the Scoping Report.\n",
